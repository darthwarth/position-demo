        <div class="main-element">
            <div class="container">
                <text class="title-base">Base Element - No position</text>
                <div class="base">
                    <text>
                        This entire parent element, contained within the double-lined border, has no 
                        positioning set within it and so it and its child elements just respect the 
                        normal page flow. The parent in this and each of the following cases contains 
                        two child elements; the title and the paragraph of text.
                        <br /><br />
                        This is here to give a point of reference for the following 
                        examples.
                    </text>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="relative-container">
                <text class="title-one">Element One - Relative position</text>
                <div class="paragraph-element relative-paragraph">
                    <text>
                        The paragraph in this example, which has a red dotted border, has a 
                        relative position, both to its top and its left of 20px. So it pushes it 
                        out of the normal page flow by these amounts.
                        <br /><br />
                        The parent element is surrounded by a double border. The relative positioning 
                        of this paragraph of text pushes it out of its parent's border, as the parent 
                        is still the size it would be if the positioning was not set.
                    </text>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="absolute-container">
                <text class="title-two">Element Two - Absolute position</text>
                <div class="paragraph-element absolute-paragraph">
                    <text>
                        The entire element in this example has had its absolute position set 200px 
                        from the top of the page and 20px from the left.
                        <br /><br />
                        Using this setting will force the parent element to behave as though the 
                        child element isn't there, removing it from the normal page flow, hence 
                        why the positioning is now based on the page rather than the parent.
                        <br /><br />
                        To make an absolutely positioned element position based on its parent 
                        rather than the page, set the parent's position to relative.
                    </text>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="fixed-container">
                <text class="title-three">Element Three - Fixed position</text>
                <div class="paragraph-element fixed-paragraph">
                    <text>
                        Setting the fixed position on an element behaves in a similar way to the 
                        absolute property, except a fixed element is not affected by scrolling. As 
                        the rest of the non-fixed elements scrolled with the page, the fixed elements 
                        would stay as set.
                        <br /><br />
                        The entire element in this example has had its fixed position set 450px 
                        from the top of the page and 20px from the right.
                    </text>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-container">
                <text class="title-four">Element Four - Sticky position</text>
                <div class="paragraph-element sticky-paragraph">
                    <text>
                        Setting the position to sticky acts in a similar way to combining relative and 
                        fixed positions. In that the element will stay where it is until the position 
                        specified in the CSS is met, for example top: 50px.
                        <br /><br />
                        In this particular example the title has is sticky position set to 80vh, so 
                        will remain where it is until that position is scrolled past, at which point the 
                        title element stays where it is on the screen while remaining within the parent 
                        element.
                    </text>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div>
                <div class="demo-container">
                    <div class="profile-title">
                        <img class="profile-image" src="profile-img.jpg" width="130" height="110">
                        <text class="demo-title">Demonstration - Mixing some styles together</text>
                    </div>
                    <div class="paragraph-element demo-paragraph">
                        <text>
                            In this mock profile card demo the image has a relative position set to 
                            -20px to both the top and the left, pushing it outside its container so it 
                            overlaps. The title has its position set to absolute by 5vh from the top. 
                            Which moves it down from the top of the containing border.
                            <br /><br />
                            The overall card itself has its position set to fixed 50px from the bottom 
                            of the page and 50px from the right.
